# AternosAPI (Forked from [Duerocraft/AternosAPI](https://github.com/Duerocraft/AternosAPI))

## Usage
 To initiate the API, you need to provide the cookies as the parameter, and voila, it will work.
 Now, there are only a few main methods available at the current moment:
 ```python
 API.StartServer()
 API.StopServer()
 API.GetServerInfo()
 ```
 More features will be along the way.

## Features
 - [x] Start/Stop the server
 - [x] Get Info (i.e. IP, Port, version) from the server
 - [] Getting and setting server options (i.e. gamemode, authentication etc) (Work In progress)
 - [] Getting console log upon server crash for debug purposes (Work In progress)
 - [] Using server console from within this API (Work In progress)
 - [] Logging in using username and password instead of cookies (Work In progress)

Here is a video made by the original owner [Duerocraft](https://github.com/Duerocraft) explaining the main working of this API (Note that in this version, you do not need to find the SEC parameter) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGM9V9tHJ2o

Now, get back to mining and have a fun experience!
